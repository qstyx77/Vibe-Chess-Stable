                <PieceRule title="Piece Levels">
                  Pieces level up by capturing opponent pieces or consuming Shrooms üçÑ and do not have a maximum level (except Queens, capped at L7). Each piece type gains different abilities as it levels up. (See individual piece sections for details).
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Pawn Promotion (Rank)">
                  When a Pawn (not a Commander, Hero, or Infiltrator) reaches the opponent's back rank, it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight of the same color. The promoted piece starts at Level 1. If the promotion move also captured an opponent's piece, the promoted piece gains levels accordingly.
                </PieceRule>
                 <PieceRule title="Commander Promotion to Hero (Rank)">
                  When a Commander reaches the opponent's back rank, it is automatically promoted to a Hero. The Hero retains the Commander's current level. If the Commander was Level 5 or higher, its player receives an extra turn.

                  If a player delivers check to the opponent's King AND earns an extra turn (either through a Level 5+ pawn/commander promotion or a streak of 6) on the same move, it is an immediate checkmate, and that player wins.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Push-Back Self-Check (Auto-Loss)">
                  If a Level 4+ Pawn or Commander uses its Push-Back ability, and this push directly results in its own King being put into check, it is an immediate loss for the player who made the push. The opponent wins by auto-checkmate.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Threefold Repetition">
                  If the same board position (including piece and item locations, current player, castling rights, and en passant target square) occurs three times during a game, the game is a draw.

                <PieceRule title="En Passant Capture">
                  If an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands on a square adjacent (same rank, different file) to one of your pawns, your pawn may capture the opponent's pawn "en passant" (in passing).
                  This capture must be made on the very next turn. Your pawn moves to the square the opponent's pawn *skipped over*. The opponent's pawn is removed from the board.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Promotion to Infiltrator">
                  When one of your pawns successfully captures an opponent's pawn via En Passant, your pawn is immediately promoted to an "Infiltrator". It retains the level it had as a pawn (including any level gained from the en passant capture itself).
                  The Infiltrator is visually distinct (it appears as a Pawn with a skull üíÄ overlay).

                      <strong>Movement & Capture:</strong> An Infiltrator can move one square directly forward OR one square diagonally forward. It captures in the same manner (one square forward or one square diagonally forward).

                     <li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Winning Condition - Infiltration:</strong> If an Infiltrator reaches the opponent's back rank, its player immediately wins the game by "Infiltration". This win condition overrides checkmate or stalemate.

                     <li>

                <PieceRule title="Commander Promotion (First Blood)">
                  The player who achieves First Blood immediately gets to select one of their own Level 1 Pawns currently on the board. This chosen Pawn is instantly promoted to a "Commander".
                  The Commander is visually distinct (it appears as a Pawn with a star üåü overlay).
                </PieceRule>

                  If a standard Pawn (not already a Commander) captures an enemy Commander, that Pawn is immediately promoted to a Commander. It retains its current level. This promotion happens automatically and does not use the "First Blood" selection process.

                      <strong>Promotion to Hero:</strong> When a Commander reaches the opponent's back rank, it is automatically promoted to a "Hero". The Hero retains the Commander's current level.
