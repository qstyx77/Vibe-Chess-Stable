                <PieceRule title="Objective">Checkmate the opponent's King.</PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Piece Levels">
                  Pieces level up by capturing opponent pieces and do not have a maximum level. Each piece type gains different abilities as it levels up. (See individual piece sections for details).
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Pawn Promotion (Rank)">
                  When a Pawn (not a Commander) reaches the opponent's back rank, it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight of the same color. The promoted piece starts at Level 1. If the promotion move also captured an opponent's piece, the promoted piece gains levels accordingly.
                  If the Pawn was Level 5 or higher before promoting, its player gets an extra turn immediately after promotion.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Castling">Standard chess castling rules apply (King and Rook must not have moved, path clear, King not in check, and King doesn't pass through or land on an attacked square).</PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Auto-Checkmate on Extra Turn">
                  If a player delivers check to the opponent's King AND earns an extra turn (either through a Level 5+ pawn promotion or a streak of 6) on the same move, it is an immediate checkmate, and that player wins.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Threefold Repetition">
                  If the same board position (including piece and item locations, current player, and castling rights) occurs three times during a game, the game is a draw.

              <AccordionContent>
                <PieceRule title="First Blood">
                  The first player to capture an enemy piece during the game achieves "First Blood". This capture can be a standard piece capture or a capture resulting from an Anvil being pushed by a Pawn.
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Commander Promotion (First Blood)">
                  The player who achieves First Blood immediately gets to select one of their own Level 1 Pawns currently on the board. This chosen Pawn is instantly promoted to a "Commander".
                  The Commander is visually distinct (it appears as a Pawn with a star overlay).
                </PieceRule>
                <PieceRule title="Commander Promotion (Pawn Captures Commander)">
                  If a standard Pawn (not already a Commander) captures an enemy Commander, that Pawn is immediately promoted to a Commander. It retains its current level. This promotion happens automatically and does not use the "First Blood" selection process.

                      <strong>Movement & Standard Abilities:</strong> A Commander moves, captures, and gains leveled abilities exactly like a standard Pawn of its current level (see Pawn Abilities section). Commanders do not promote further by reaching the opponent's back rank.

This does not affect the Commander itself. If a Pawn promoted from this ability becomes a Queen, its level is still capped at 7.
